\section{Experiments}

Examples we have:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Azureus (at least two leaks.  need to find some non-leak examples as well.)
\item jEdit
\item Jetty
\item Derby
\item could potentially look at Java version of BerkelyDB---though only major releases are available (no fine-grained SVN-level updates).
\end{enumerate}

For each of these, we can do a few experiments.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The simplest is just to find a change and check that we can
  synthesize the transformer when presented with the versions on
  either side (as given by SVN).  That is, the only thing that has
  changed is the code that directly relates to the change we are
  interested in.
\item Next we can check that we still find this transformer when we
  look at the major versions on either side of the targeted change.
  So now more code has been modified.  We still give the matching tool
  the name of the class we are targeting though.
\item The highest goal would be to give the system two major versions
  and see what percentage of classes we can synthesize updates for.
\end{enumerate}
