on technical contributions that can only be understood in light of
reading the entire paper, as opposed to the summary of contributions

have explained and shown why the evidence that supports all the
claims, and can make deeper technical statements.  Point to future
work.  Restate the meaning of this paper.

Please accept this wonderful paper.
