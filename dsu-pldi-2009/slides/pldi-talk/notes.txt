Good morning.

This is joint work with Michael Hicks at the Univ. of Maryland and my
advisor Kathryn McKinley. This talk is about Jvolve, a Java Virtual Machine
with Dynamic Software Updating support.

Software developers update applications by fixing bugs and adding new
features. These updates find their way into deployed systems. The common
way to update an application is to stop it, and restart with the new
version. This situation is not desirable in several contexts. Some mission
critical applications just cannot tolerate downtime. I have come to know
that the ESA employs a primitive form of online
updates for managed langauge code in its satellites. If you are an online
retailer any downtime will result in loss in revenue. And, I am sure we all
desire not having to restart our OS after a software update.

One solution is Dynamic Software Updating or DSU for short. This is what we
mean by DSU.

The left of the screen shows a process running version 1 of an application.
On the right is a process running version 2. DSU means going from the
picture on the left to that on the right. This typically involves checking
that the system is in a safe state for the update, and if so, updating code
and data. The main innovations in our work lie in how we enforce safe
points for the update, and how we udpate data.
