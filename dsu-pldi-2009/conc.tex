\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

This paper presents \DSU, a Java virtual machine with support for
dynamic software updating.  \DSU{} is the most full-featured,
best-performing implementation of DSU for Java published to date.  We
demonstrate its flexibility and safety by successfully applying updates
for one to two years worth of releases for three programs: Jetty
webserver, JavaEmailServer, and CrossFTP server.  \DSU{} imposes no
overhead during a program's steady-state  execution.  
\DSU's DSU support builds naturally
on top of existing VM services, including dynamic class loading,
thread synchronization, return barriers, on-stack replacement, JIT compilation, and
garbage collection.  It is probably optimistic to believe that DSU
will be able to support every update.  Nevertheless, our results
demonstrate that dynamic software updating support can be naturally
incorporated into modern VMs, and that doing so has the potential to
significantly improve software availability by reducing downtime.
