Researchers have designed and implemented dynamic updating solutions in a variety of contexts, ranging from
theoretical models of updates and safety, to language design for dynamic
updating, to practical \USD systems for C and Java, and to operating systems
with \USD support. In this chapter, we compare our VM-centric approach to
DSU with related work on implementing \USD for managed languages, C, and
C++.

\section{Summary}
Table~\ref{tab:related} summarises features, strengths, and limitations of four
DSU systems for C/C++ --- Ginseng, Upstare, Ksplice, and K42; updates in a
persistent object store; and three DSU systems for Java --- JDrums, DVM,
and Jvolve. The table denotes advantages of a system with a `\Y',
disadvantages with `\N', and neutral features with a `\Z'.
But for Upstare's generic stack reconstruction support, Jvolve
is superior to every other DSU system in one or more ways.

This recent surge in the design and development of dynamic updating system
shows a rising demand for highly available software and the limitations in
other systems reveal the difficulties inherent in combining performance,
efficiency, and flexibility as we did in \JV.
