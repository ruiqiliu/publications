\label{sec:implementation}

This section describes how \JV supports dynamic updating by extending
common virtual machine services.  \JV is built on \RVM, a
high-performance Java-in-Java Research VM~\cite{AAB+:99,VMperf:webpage}.
\JV integrates and extends \RVM's dynamic classloader, JIT compiler,
thread scheduler, copying garbage collector (GC), and support for return
barriers and on-stack replacement to implement dynamic updating.

After the user prepares and tests a program's modifications, the update
process in \JV proceeds in five steps.  (1)~\UPT generates an update
specification.  (2)~The user signals \JV.  (3)~\JV stops running threads
at a DSU safe point. (4)~It loads the updated classes, the transformer
functions, and installs the modified methods and classes.  (5)~\JV then
applies object and class transformers following a modified GC\@.
