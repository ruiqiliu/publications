\section{Conclusion}

Our evaluation shows that
% \JV is one of the most efficient among dynamic updating systems.
\JV is the first full-featured dynamic updating system that imposes no
steady-state overhead. To perform an update, \JV pauses the application
for a modest time period, roughly equal to a full heap garbage collection
pause. \JV is the most versatile dynamic updating system for Java and
supports 20 of 22 real-world updates written over a one to two year period
to three open-source server programs.
