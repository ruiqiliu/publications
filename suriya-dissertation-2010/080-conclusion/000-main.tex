This dissertation presents \JV, a Java Virtual Machine with support for
Dynamic Software Updating. \JV is the most fully-featured, best-performing DSU
implementation for Java to date. The key contribution of this dissertation is
showing how to achieve safe, flexible, and efficient dynamic software
updating by extending existing Virtual Machine services including dynamic
class loading, thread synchronization, return barriers, on-stack
replacement, just-in-time compilation, and garbage collection. We
demonstrate \JV's success by applying updates for one to two years worth of
releases for three programs: Jetty webserver, JavaEmailServer, and CrossFTP
server.

This dissertation explores state transformers with behavior that depends on
each object's state, and uses such transformers to repair application state
at update time for certain classes of bugs. This dissertation also
introduces a novel dynamic analysis to automatically generate
object-specific transformers.

Our work demonstrates how dynamic software updating support can be
integrated into modern VMs, and that doing so has the potential to
significantly improve software availability by reducing downtime.
