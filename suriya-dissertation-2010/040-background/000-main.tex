This chapter presents an overview of the dynamic updating problem.
It discusses the semantics of
updates, explains safety guarantees that \USD systems provide, and presents
mechanisms that systems employ to support \USD. This chapter focuses on DSU
system requirements and mechanisms, whereas Chapter~\ref{chap:related}
covers how prior systems chose among them.

The goal of \USD is to avoid application downtime in the face of software
updates. Researchers have addressed the problem of dynamic updating in
various contexts such as standalone and server applications, distributed
computing, distributed object stores, and databases for various types of
code updates, and types of code and data updates. This dissertation
considers updating a single application process, changing code and data to
be as expected by the new version.
% \USD systems achieve this goal by dynamically updating a running
% application, changing code and data to be as expected by the new version.

\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we presented an overview of the dynamic software updating
problem.  We discussed mechanisms for updating code and data that meet
desirable safety guarantees while processing the update in a timely
fashion.
