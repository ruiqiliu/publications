\label{sec:schedule}

This section describes the current status of our work and our plan for the
future.

\paragraph{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item We have a proof-of-concept implementation that demonstrates \acf{DSU} for
Java by supporting two years worth of updates to three server applications.
This submission is currently under review.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Plan}
\begin{itemize}
\item We are in the early stages of modifying \acf{OSR} to support
\acs{DSU}. We plan to have an implementation by middle of September 2008.
We will then work on making the implementation more robust with a better \acf{UPT};
\DSU{} running on multiprocessors; and better analysis of applications and
performance. We intend to have a submission to PLDI 2009 (deadline:
November 2008).
\item Starting September 2008, we will begin exploring other object
transformation models; starting with 1) running object transformation
functions within the collector while copying objects, and then moving on to
2) supporting DSU in a concurrent collector (January 2009 - May 2009).
\item We intend to examine more applications during Summer 2009, spend Fall
writing the dissertation, with an expected graduation date in the Fall of
2009.
\end{itemize}
