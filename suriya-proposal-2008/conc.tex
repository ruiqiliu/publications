\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

This proposal has presented \DSU{}, a Java virtual machine with support for
dynamic software updating.  \DSU{} is the most full-featured,
best-performing implementation of DSU for Java published to date.  To
show that it can support changes that occur in practice, we
successfully applied updates for one to two years
% that correspond to most of a year-and-a-half's
worth of releases for three 
programs, Jetty webserver, JavaEmailServer, and CrossFTP server.  \DSU{}
imposes no overhead during a program's normal execution---the only
overhead occurs at the time of the update.  \DSU{}'s DSU support
builds naturally on top of existing VM services, including dynamic class
loading, \acs{JIT} compilation, thread synchronization, and garbage
collection. For the remaining work, we will extend \acs{OSR}, thread
synchronization on multiprocessors, and concurrent collection.
Our results demonstrate that dynamic software updating
support can be naturally incorporated into modern VMs, and that doing so has
the potential to significantly improve software availability.
